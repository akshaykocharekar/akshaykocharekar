# 👋 Hey there, I'm Akshay Kocharekar

I'm a second-year BCA student with a big love for tech and creativity. I spend most of my time building cool stuff on the web using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  

Whether it’s crafting smooth UI with React or wiring up backend APIs with Node.js, I’m all about turning ideas into real, working projects.

---

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

- Building full-stack web apps that actually solve problems
- Diving deeper into JavaScript, React, Node, and MongoDB
- Always learning something new (and breaking a few things on the way 😉)

---

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate On

- React & MERN stack projects  
- Portfolio websites / web tools  
- Fun side projects & open source ideas
